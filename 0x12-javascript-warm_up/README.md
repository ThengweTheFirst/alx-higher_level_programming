# Solutions for 0x12-JavaScript-warm-up

Task 0
#mandatory
Write a script that prints "Javascript is amazing"

Task 1
#mandatory
Write a script that prints 3 lines:
-> "C is fun"
-> "Python is cool"
-> "Javascript is amazing"

Task 2
#mandatory
Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:
-> if no arguments are passed to the  script, print "No argument"
-> If only one argument is passed to the script, print "Argument found"
-> Otherwise, print "Argument found"

Task 3
#mandatory
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:
-> if no arguments are passed to the script, print "No argument"

Task 4
#mandatory
Write a that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: "is"

Task 5
#mandatory
Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:
-> if the argument can't be converted to an interger, print "Not a number"

Task 6
#mandatory
Write a script thatprints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop:
-> The first line: “C is fun”
-> The second line: “Python is cool”
-> The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”

Task 7
#mandatory
Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”
Where x is the first argument of the script
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
-> You can use only two console.log
-> You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

Task 8
#mandatory
Write a script that prints a square
The first argument is the size of the square
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
-> you must use the character X to print the square

Task 9
#mandatory
Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers
-> the first argument is the first integer
-> the second argument is the second integer
-> you have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)

Task 10
#mandatory
Write a script that computes and prints a factorial
The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
Factorial of NaN is 1
-> you must do it recursively

Task 11
#mandatory
Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.
You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
-> if no argument passed, print 0
-> if the number of arguments is 1, print 0

Task 12
#mandatory
Update this script to replace the value 12 with 89:
-> you are not allowed to use var

Task 13
#mandatory

Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.
-> the function must be visible from outside
-> the name of the function must be add

Task 14
#advanced
Write a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333

Task 15
#advanced
Write a function that executes x times a function.
-> the function must be visible from outside

Task 16
#advanced
Write a function that increments and calls a function.
-> the function must be visible from outside

Task 17
#advanced
Update this script by adding a new function incr that increments the integer value.
